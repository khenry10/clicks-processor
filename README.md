// first check to see if any IP has more than 10 clicks and disgard
  // create a count function that pulls IP out and counts them
// return Most expensive click from each IP within one hour period
  // 1) need to grab first elgible click (aka 10 or less clicks),
  // 2) determine the time range (1 hour from the timestamp)
  // 3) collect the clicks within the time range with same IP as initial click
  // 4) return click with the greatest "amount"
  // 5)repeat steps 2 - 4 to see if there are any clicks within an hour range of the winning click
// if there is a tie, the earlier click wins
